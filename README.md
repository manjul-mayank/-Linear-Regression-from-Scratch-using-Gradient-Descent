# -Linear-Regression-from-Scratch-using-Gradient-Descent
Welcome to this project where we implement Linear Regression from scratch using only NumPy and Matplotlib, and optimize the parameters using the Gradient Descent algorithm. This notebook is designed for students and enthusiasts who want to deeply understand how gradient-based optimization works behind the scenes of machine learning models.
